Open Source Clothing Pattern Creation
This was a fun project I did which allows you to create a Hoodie pattern using your own body measurements, a bespoke pattern just for you!
* Once the pattern is created you can create a pdf and print it in 1:1 scale and cut your material from that.
* There are default ease mesurements sets allowing you to create S M L patterns.
* By adjusting the settings you can create a Hoddie with different hood shapes.
* On the Android version, which was the version released to the Google app store, you can zoom in and out using touch.
* IOS version never implemented, UWP version working
* This uses the SkiaSharp, a wrapper for Skia to draw the vector graphics
